   abstract      = "Computer simulations are invaluable tools for scientific
                    discovery. However, accurate simulations are often slow to
                    execute, which limits their applicability to extensive
                    parameter exploration, large-scale data analysis, and
                    uncertainty quantification. A promising route to accelerate
                    simulations by building fast emulators with machine learning
                    requires large training datasets, which can be prohibitively
                    expensive to obtain with slow simulations. Here we present a
                    method based on neural architecture search to build accurate
                    emulators even with a limited number of training data. The
                    method successfully accelerates simulations by up to 2
                    billion times in 10 scientific cases including astrophysics,
                    climate science, biogeochemistry, high energy density
                    physics, fusion energy, and seismology, using the same
                    super-architecture, algorithm, and hyperparameters. Our
                    approach also inherently provides emulator uncertainty
                    estimation, adding further confidence in their use. We
                    anticipate this work will accelerate research involving
                    expensive simulations, allow more extensive parameters
                    exploration, and enable new, previously unfeasible
                    computational discovery.",

  @ARTICLE{gcfref7,
    title         = "Sequence Transduction with Recurrent Neural Networks",
    author        = "Graves, Alex",
    abstract      = "Many machine learning tasks can be expressed as the
                     transformation---or \textbackslashemph\{transduction\}---of
                     input sequences into output sequences: speech recognition,
                     machine translation, protein secondary structure prediction
                     and text-to-speech to name but a few. One of the key
                     challenges in sequence transduction is learning to represent
                     both the input and output sequences in a way that is
                     invariant to sequential distortions such as shrinking,
                     stretching and translating. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
                     are a powerful sequence learning architecture that has
                     proven capable of learning such representations. However
                     RNNs traditionally require a pre-defined alignment between
                     the input and output sequences to perform transduction. This
                     is a severe limitation since \textbackslashemph\{finding\}
                     the alignment is the most difficult aspect of many sequence
                     transduction problems. Indeed, even determining the length
                     of the output sequence is often challenging. This paper
                     introduces an end-to-end, probabilistic sequence
                     transduction system, based entirely on RNNs, that is in
                     principle able to transform any input sequence into any
                     finite, discrete output sequence. Experimental results for
                     phoneme recognition are provided on the TIMIT speech corpus.",

abstract  ="Molecular dynamics simulations are often key to the understanding of the mechanism{,} rate and yield of chemical reactions. One current challenge is the in-depth analysis of the large amount of data produced by the simulations{,} in order to produce valuable insight and general trends. In the present study{,} we propose to employ recent machine learning analysis tools to extract relevant information from simulation data without a priori knowledge on chemical reactions. This is demonstrated by training machine learning models to predict directly a specific outcome quantity of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations – the timescale of the decomposition of 1{,}2-dioxetane. The machine learning models accurately reproduce the dissociation time of the compound. Keeping the aim of gaining physical insight{,} it is demonstrated that{,} in order to make accurate predictions{,} the models evidence empirical rules that are{,} today{,} part of the common chemical knowledge. This opens the way for conceptual breakthroughs in chemistry where machine analysis would provide a source of inspiration to humans."}
